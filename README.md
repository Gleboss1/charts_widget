# Runtime charts widget Qt5
A widget that allows you to draw charts in real time.

## Possibilities
- creation and processing of multiple tabs
- on each tab, you can create a grid from graphs of arbitrary size (maximum 4x4)
- multiple series of data can be displayed on each chart
- for each chart, you can set the display interval for both axes and their name, the name of the chart itself
- for each data series, you can customize the color, type and thickness of the line, the signature in the legend
- saving each graph in JPEG format (right-click on the graph) and the entire tab (in the menu)
